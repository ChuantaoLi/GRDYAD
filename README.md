# Graph Regularized Dynamic Sampling AdaBoost

## Datasets

​		In the `Experiment1` folder two real diagnostic return visit datasets for Ischemic Heart Disease provided by the CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology, Italy can be found. Survival7Y and Survival10Y represent the data sets for 7-and 10-year return visits, respectively. Description for the two data sets and source: https://github.com/orientino/ml4cad. Furthermore, can be found in `Experiment2` folder KEEL database of eight binary classification data sets, they are the source of https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/imbalanced.php?order=name#sub10.

## Code

​		`Ablation_test.py` is the ablation experiment code for the IHD dataset. `AdaBoost.py` is the code for traditional AdaBoost. `DSAD.py` contains dynamic oversampling and dynamic undersampling code. `GRDSAD.py` is the Model code proposed in this study. `Model_test.py` is the code for the comparison experiment of multiple Machine Learning models on the IHD dataset.
